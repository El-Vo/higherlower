# How to try out your project

To run the project, open a `terminal` in your projects root-folder, then run the following command:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

You can now navigate to your `frontend` in your browser at `http://localhost`, reach your `backend` at `localhost:5000`, and find a `postgresql` database at `localhost:5432`.
